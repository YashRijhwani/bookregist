## Description

`Bookilyx Books Search with Google` is a `MERN` stack application, utilizing `MongoDB`, `Express`, `React`, and `Node`.

This full-stack application allows the user to utilize the `Google Books API` to look up books they're interested in, save to the database, and view their page on the Google Books website.

---

## Code Explanation

The application utilizes `react-router-dom` to load React components according to the path hit on the webpage. This allows us to render seperate pages in a React application.
