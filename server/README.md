# Bookshelf Registry Server

This is the server-side component of a bookshelf registry application built with Express and Node.js. It provides the backend API endpoints for managing a collection of books in a bookshelf.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Provides a set of RESTful API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.
- **Middleware**: Utilizes Express middleware for parsing incoming requests, handling CORS, and serving static files in production.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for storing and retrieving book data.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file for configuring the server.

## Getting Started

To get started with the bookshelf registry server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/samthatcode/BookShelf-Registry.git
   cd BookShelf-Registry/server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Define the following environment variables:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
     ```

4. **Start the Server**:
   ```
   npm start
   nodemon server.js
   ```

5. **API Documentation**:
   - Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` for detailed information on available endpoints and request/response formats.

## Dependencies

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
